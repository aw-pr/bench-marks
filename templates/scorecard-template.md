## Tool provenance

Record the exact model and harness behind each row. This is mandatory: a Cursor
or any row whose underlying model is not recorded is an uninterpretable
datapoint — see the void rule in `rubric.md`.

| Tool row | Harness | Underlying model | Provider |
|----------|---------|------------------|----------|
| claude | Claude Code (native) | {{e.g. Opus 4.7}} | Anthropic |
| codex | Codex CLI (native) | {{e.g. GPT-5.5 x-high}} | OpenAI |
| cursor | Cursor (wrapper) | {{REQUIRED — the exact model Cursor was set to}} | {{Anthropic / OpenAI / other}} |
| gemini | Gemini (native) | {{e.g. gemini-2.5-pro}} | Google |

**Harness-isolation note.** Cursor wraps someone else's model, so its row is
only meaningful read against the native row of the *same* model:

- Cursor on an Anthropic model → compare to the `claude` row. Any delta is
  Cursor's scaffolding (context handling, tool loop, autocomplete), not the model.
- Cursor on an OpenAI/Codex model → compare to the `codex` row, same logic.

State which native row Cursor is being diffed against and what the delta tells
you, in the Cursor per-tool note below. If Cursor's model can't be established,
mark the row void rather than guessing.

## Per-tool notes

### Claude (Claude Max / Opus)

*Observations, failure modes, surprises.*

### Codex (Codex Plus)

*Observations, failure modes, surprises.*

### Cursor (Cursor Pro)

*Observations, failure modes, surprises.*

*Harness delta — required: which native row this is diffed against (claude or
codex, per the model recorded in Tool provenance), and what differs that is
attributable to Cursor's harness rather than the model itself.*

### Gemini (Gemini Plus)

*Observations, failure modes, surprises.*
